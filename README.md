# userOS
This is the official repository for userOS, a fake operating system base made in VB.NET.

userOS is designed as a base that can be used for many things, for example - a game that focuses around a fake operating system.

# Trying out userOS
To try out userOS, you can compile it or download a release (if available).

# Compiling
To compile userOS, you need Visual Studio 2019 with VB.NET installed. .NET Framework 4.0 is also a requirement.
The rest of the compilation process is pretty easy.
